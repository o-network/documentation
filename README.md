# Network

## Concept

The most basic way to outline of the vision is to describe a graph made up of nodes and edges/links, each node and edge can have basic information stored against it, each new edge or node will emit events that can be listened to, this leads to being able to react to information changes in real time while building a logical representation of the underlying data. 

This graph doesn't need to be stored in a graph database, or be stored in a database at all, it could be an in memory data set. 

This documentation is going to describe the basic structure of the graph, and how the graph can be interacted with.

The intended audience of this documentation is developers looking to implement the graph in their own langauge or infrastructure.
